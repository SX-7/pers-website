    Some context: In Poland, there's a social media website called Wykop. It's
    similar to 4chan - excluding (in)famous /b/ or /pol/ - and it has a pretty
    similar reach locally. It also has a microblogging section. I never used the
    website.

    Wykop's sentiment analyzer. Originally, we had no idea what we should choose
    as a project, but our professor suggested that we should perhaps try and
    create some sort of sentiment analyzer, possibly for Wykop. So, that's what
    we did. I worked on the backend, and the rest of my team worked on the
    frontend.

    <div class="py-2">The pipeline went more or less like that:</div>
    <div>
      <div class="font-bold">👉 Spoof a new token</div>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2">
      <div class="font-bold">👉 Get new data for selected tags</div>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2">
      <div class="font-bold">👉 Process the data</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center">
    <img
      class="rounded-3xl p-4"
      src="../images/projects/wykopinion.png"
      alt="Screenshot of wykopinion.com main page"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="text-opium-500 text-center italic">Much graph, very cool</div>
  <div class="pt-4">
    And after all that, whenever someone visits the website, they can look at a
    nice graph. To be absolutely honest, I think it's a terrible source of any
    information. I wouldn't recommend it as a tool. But, it was a great
    experience. Working to make it, well, sorta work. Finishing parsing data
    backlog very close to deadline. Hapiness from being done with it, but also a
    feeling of "I could've made it better". In the end, it's done.
