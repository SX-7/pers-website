    Some context: In Poland, there's a social media website called Wykop. It's
    similar to 4chan - excluding (in)famous /b/ or /pol/ - and it has a
    pretty similar reach locally. It also has a microblogging section. I never
    used the website.

    Wykop's sentiment analyzer. Originally, we had no idea what we should choose
    as a project, but our professor suggested that we should perhaps try and
    create some sort of sentiment analyzer, possibly for Wykop. So, that's what
    we did. I worked on the backend, and the rest of my team worked on the
    frontend.

    <div class="p-2">The pipeline went more or less like that:</div>
    <div class="pt-2">
      <div>üòé Spoof a new token</div>
      <div class="indent-8 pt-1">
        This happens once a day. Obtaining a token with official
        API had some weird quirks, and even though we had been granted official
        access to it, we went this route instead. Also we had this part working
        already well before the official access, so it was too bothersome to
        switch.

    <div class="pt-2">
      <div>‚¨áÔ∏è Get new data for selected tags</div>
      <div class="indent-8 pt-1">
        We decided to request new data every 15 minutes or so. While that feels
        redundant, it did allow me to simplify many parts of the code. Most
        importantly, if the website was down for some time, or a new tag was
        added, that'd let us fasttrack the analysis. And, as we didn't go
        with faster times, we also had no risk of being shutdown from DoS-ing
        Wykop's API.

    <div class="pt-2">
      <div>üîÑ Process the data</div>
      <div class="indent-8 pt-1">
        Translate, then put results into Google's sentiment AI, then put results into
        Datastore. That was pretty simple, except for the part where it cost us
        $200 in a single day... mostly due to costs of translation. Turns out
        text translation is pretty costly after going above the free
        translations count. Luckily, the free gift credit that Google gives out
        was able to withstand these costs.

    And after all that, whenever someone visits the website, they can look at a
    nice graph. To be absolutely honest, I think it's a terrible source of any
    information. I wouldn't recommend it as a tool. But, it was a great
    experience. Working to make it, well, sorta work. Finishing parsing data
    very close to deadline. Hapiness from being done with it, but also a feeling
    of "I could've made it better". In the end, it's done.
