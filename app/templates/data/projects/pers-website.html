    That's right, this website is also being made by me, with it's code on
    GitHub!
  </div>
  <div class="pt-2">
    This is my first forray into frontend development, and in the end I decided
    to go with the easiest path possible:
  </div>
  <ol class="list-inside list-disc pb-2">
    <li>
      Flask. I know it from a previous web project I was working on. Also
      Python, which I'm quite fond of. <em>Also</em> also, jinja templating,
      which I already use in Ansible, too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tailwind for CSS. While it does have some bad rep for humongous class
      lists, it also abstracts CSS syntax into its own, nice system. Now I only
      have to deal with how CSS works, and inline styling gave me a lot of
      flexibility in this department.
    </li>
    <li>
      Alpine.js for JS stuff. Another tool focused on inline work, another help
      with learning something I don't really know.
    </li>
    <li>
      Google Cloud Platform. Another platform I know how to work with, also
      still had some free credit left. Not that it heavily matters, as with
      predicted traffic of approx. 1 user monthly it'd easily fall within the
      free tier of App Engine.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="py-2">
    Overall, it's a pretty fun experience, and probably will be one of the
    things I will both finish (or have 1.0 release), and will be using after
    being done with it.

    FYI - the

    repo is seperate, and it's using Quartz with not that many modifications.
