  <div class="py-2">
    Pretty simple python app, intended for Termux, that just got unmaintainable
    due to many, many ad-hoc fixes through mobile phone.
  </div>
  <div class="py-2">
    Lack of wide screen, and no proper, sensible dev enironment led to fixes
    that looked good locally, but just messied up the code globally.<br />
    Also, I feel like I fell victim to some sort of scope creep. Or maybe it was
    just me meeting harsh reality of doing anything longer than 50 lines and one
    level of nesting.
  </div>
  <div class="py-2">
    In retrospection what definitely would've helped was getting some
    abstractions going, objects, (even singletons), and overall making the code
    sensible, and readable.<br />
    Not "Ummm, is it x then y, or y then x? And are they from top, or bottom?".
  </div>
  <div class="py-2">
    In the end, I got stuck on implementing a nice looking speechbubble, and
    just decided to archive the project, indefinitely. Coincidentally, the trend
    also died down already, so I'm probably not returning to it.

    As can be seen, not only is the usability bad due to very limited resolution
    of terminal displays, but the end result is less asthetically pleasing than
    commonly found alternatves - even though the user can adjust speechbubble
    height and pointer position, the bubble isn't properly computed with maths.
