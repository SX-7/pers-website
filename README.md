# A very nice website ðŸ™‚
Code for my own portfolio/personal website. 

Currently hosted at [sx7.dev](https://sx7.dev) with GCL App Engine, planning to slowly but surely update it over time.

"Tech" "stack" currently consists of:
- Python ([Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/))
- [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)

Choices mostly dictated by improving coding experience without sacrificing any flexibility, while keeping it relatively newcomer-friendly vanilia.
